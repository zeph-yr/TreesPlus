🌱 🌱 🌱 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌲 🌲 🌲 🌴 🌴 🌴

### How To Use
1. Place `TreesPlus.dll` into your `Plugins` folder
2. Decide how much you or your viewers wish to donate for each miss. You can change this amount any time during your streams.
3. Adjust the slider to change your donation amount. Click `Refresh Donations!` to refresh the counter immediately. Counter will also automatically refresh when the map loads if you forget to click this button.
4. Your misses are visually displayed as a forest of trees (based on leading tree planting non-profit organizations rate of $1.00 planting 1 tree).
5. To reset the counter and start over, delete `TreesPlus.json` in `UserData`
6. Toggle `Go Live!` to start and stop counting your misses.
7. Counter values are saved and continue from your last game session.


### Advanced Users
In `TreesPlus.json`, you can change:
- Counter's position
- Min and max of the slider
- Edit the number of misses (not recommended to edit `trees_planted` and `trees_emoji`. Use `Refresh Donations!` for that)
